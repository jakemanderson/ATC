  abstract     = {Despite increased scholarly and policy attention to prisoner reentry, much remains unknown about the factors that contribute to a successful transition from prison to society. The authors focused on a neglected but potentially critical factor, inmate visitation, that may reduce recidivism. The expectation of such an effect stems from prominent crime theories and an increasing body of work that stresses the importance of social ties to the reentry process. Using data from the Florida Department of Corrections, the authors tested hypotheses about the effects of visitation on recidivism. The measures of visitation included whether any visits occurred, the frequency and recency of visitation, and the type of visitor received (e.g., family member, friend). The authors also examined whether visitation effects varied by age, sex, race, type of instant offense, and prior incarceration. The findings indicate that visitation reduces and delays recidivism. Their implications for theory, research, and policy are discussed.}

  abstract     = {Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of pretrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.}

In this study, we evaluate the impact of introducing free digital communications (video and audio calls) across Iowa prisons. We use the staggered roll out of this technology between 2021 and 2022 to evaluate its impact on two key outcomes—infractions and adverse health outcomes while individuals are incarcerated, and recidivism once they are released. Early results suggest that prison misconduct declined meaningfully after the introduction of free communications.}

The sample consisted of 124 parolees from Hawaii State Prison (1969--1970). Contacts with the community were measured by letters and visits received during the year before parole. Recidivism was tracked for 2 years until 1972. Of the sample, 30 recidivated and 94 did not. A weak trend supported the hypothesis, but t tests did not; sign tests were partially significant. Findings align with prior studies suggesting strong family and community ties reduce recidivism, but generalization is cautioned. Hawaii's correctional administration responded by creating Conditional Release Centers providing monitored community work and weekend furloughs.}

People with scores of 5-10 will violate parole in 3\% of cases, while people with scores of -5 and -6 will violate parole in 75\% of cases. Out of an originally suggested list of 27 factors, only 12 were significantly useful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The children of prisoners can suffer from behavioral issues, poor school performance, and a heightened risk of crime and delinquency across the life-course. Separation from one's family is part of what makes incarceration a punishment, but what can be done to ensure that this punishment has the least harmful effect on children? Using data from the Arizona Prison Visitation Project, the current study seeks to answer: 1) what type of prison contact (in-person, phone, or mail) is associated with greater changes in the quality of parent-child relationships?, 2) Is frequency of prison contact associated with changes in the quality of parent-child relationships?, and 3) Is a change in parent-child relationship quality associated with a change in child behavior? Examining results from the parent (N=127) and child (N=293) level, the study finds that in-person visitation is associated with increases in relationship quality. Mail contact and frequent phone contact were also found to important for relationship quality. This study provides support for the ability that prison visitation, and contact more broadly, may have to increase parent-child relationship quality. Implications of this work include considering measures to subsidize contact costs, encourage contact, and involve children in in-prison programming.},
